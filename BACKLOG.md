# RabbitEars — Backlog

Parked / not-yet-scheduled work, split out of `HANDOVER.md` (which stays the single entry point
for **current state**; this is the parking lot for **what's next**). Ship small items as 0.1.x
point releases; the **theme engine** is the big 0.2.x epic.

## 🎨 Theme engine — the big 0.2.x epic

**Goal (owner-directed):** a **full-app reskin** with **runtime-selectable skins**
(Dark / Steampunk / Cyberpunk — mockups exist) powered by **Direct3D 11 + HLSL shaders** for
animated GPU effects. Write a **`docs/THEME_ENGINE.md`** design doc first, and **flag the shared
skin-model boundary to the macOS team** before any engine code lands (they move fast on `mac/`).

**Architecture:**
- **One shared GPU device — Direct2D-on-D3D11 interop.** D2D 1.1 runs on a D3D11 device, so you get
  crisp GPU 2D (geometry, text, gradients, `ID2D1Effect` blur/glow/shadow) *and* can drop to **HLSL
  pixel shaders** for the "living" bits (flowing neon, heat-haze, reactive glows). The channel grid
  is *already* Direct2D (`Win32/ui/ChannelGridControl.cpp`, `Win32/ui/D2DSupport.h`), so it folds
  into the same device rather than fighting it. Do **not** rewrite everything in raw D3D.
- **Skin = shared model + per-platform renderer** (mirrors the meter model↔renderer seam): the skin
  **model** (theme id, asset/param/animation refs, layout) lives in **`common/`** (shared); the
  **renderer** is platform-specific — **`Win32/`** in D3D11/D2D+HLSL, **`mac/`** in Metal/Core
  Graphics later. Keeps the shared core unforked.
- **Runtime-selectable + persisted** (Settings → Theme), switchable live.

**Phased build** (each phase owner-verified — GUI rendering can't be checked in the dev sandbox):
1. **Foundation spike** — stand up the D3D11+D2D interop device + swapchain on ONE surface (the
   command/transport bar), render the *current* look at parity + prove ONE HLSL effect. De-risks the
   whole engine before committing to reskin everything. Behind a build flag.
2. **Skin abstraction** — grow `Win32/ui/Theme.h` from a flat palette into a `Skin` system (palette
   + assets + shaders + per-widget draw) + a skin registry + the runtime switch + Settings UI; define
   the skin *model* in `common/`.
3. **Reskin surfaces incrementally** — transport + meters first (the mockups), then command-bar
   chrome, then nav + grid, then dialogs.
4. **Author the sets** — Steampunk + Cyberpunk art + shaders. macOS renderer mirrors in Metal.

**Risks / coordination:**
- **D3D11 is Windows-only** and the macOS port is active → keep the skin *model* shared, the
  *renderer* per-platform; flag the boundary to the mac team early (Metal is their side).
- **libVLC owns the video surface** (its own D3D11 vout in a child HWND) → skin *around* video;
  shader-over-video needs care and probably isn't worth it early.
- **Real-time swapchain hygiene** — flip-model present, animate only when visible (don't peg GPU/CPU
  when idle), DPI/resize/occlusion handling.
- **Not a point release** — realistically a 0.2.x epic across several versions.

## Deferred epics

- **JSON profiles** (deferred since 0.1.5): per-profile settings + playlist sources, channel cache
  rebuilt per profile; `%LOCALAPPDATA%\RabbitEars\profiles\*.json` + an active-profile pointer; keep
  the ~197 MB channel cache OUT of the JSON.

## macOS

- **Validate the x86_64 (Intel) slice on real Intel hardware** — the shipped `v0.1.7-mac` is a
  universal (arm64 + x86_64) notarized DMG. The **arm64 slice is confirmed on-device (2026-07-04,
  runs + looks good)**; the **x86_64 slice has never run on a physical Intel Mac**. When an Intel
  machine is available: launch the app + run `RabbitEarsPlayProbe` (headless play smoke test) + a
  quick GUI/playback pass. Arranging hardware may take a while — parked, not blocking.

## Features

- **Recording Phase 2 (scheduled)** — DB schedule table + dialog + a timer firing the headless
  recorder at set times (app must be running). **Phase 3** — Windows Task Scheduler wake-to-record +
  EPG-driven scheduling.
- **Recording formats** — MP4 (record `.ts`, remux on stop — MP4 isn't crash-safe if written live)
  and **transcoding** (format/quality/size presets; CPU-heavy).
- **EPG** (XMLTV now/next; `tvg-id` already stored) + a **background dead-link checker** (so "Hide
  unavailable" isn't purely passive). **Import/export favourites.**
- **Resume last channel** on launch (`last_channel_id` is already persisted).
- **Named saved layouts** (`DockLayout` already serializes any tree).
- **Group-title country fallback** for Xtream feeds (whose channels lack `tvg-id` country codes).

## Polish / cleanup

- **Shared `runModalLoop` helper** — About / prompt / Categories / Terms / info / Meters each run a
  hand-rolled modal `GetMessage` loop. 0.1.7 fixed the **About** loop to re-post `WM_QUIT` (so a quit
  mid-dialog exits cleanly); the others still swallow it (benign — the 4s `WM_DESTROY` watchdog covers
  them, and none can trigger updates). Extract one correct helper and use it everywhere.
- **Clamp the remaining themed dialogs to the work area** — About / prompt / Categories / Terms / info
  centre on the parent (`Win32/ui/Dialogs.cpp`) and can clip off-screen near a screen edge. Reuse
  `clampToWorkArea()` after each dialog's centred x/y (the Meters dialog already does, since 0.1.6).
- **DPI-change relayout** (`WM_DPICHANGED`): recreate fonts, relayout, push DPI to grid/meter
  (`channelGridUpdateDpi`, `bufferMeterSetDpi`).
- **Category filter follow-ups** — remember the *last* view when toggling it, or a per-view (not
  global) category filter.

## Release / infra

- **Authenticode** code-signing of the exe + installer (silences SmartScreen; separate from the EdDSA
  update signature).
- **Portable-zip** artifact on releases (alongside the auto-updating installer).
